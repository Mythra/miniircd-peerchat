Peerchat IRC Backend
============================================================

Description
-----------

This is a backend for Peerchat, which is a GameSpy service that allows simple and easy game to game chat. It is using the code of miniircd, a small and limited IRC server written in Python.

Features
--------
* Pok√©mon Generation 4 WFC Plaza support.

Limitations
-----------

* Generic server, some chankeys are copied across games.
* Not all plaza types show, only Bulbasaur.
* Time is not resynced across all users; each user starts with 20 minutes, meaning some users disconnect before others.

Usage
-----

To use this, you will first need to run the server itself on port 6668; `python miniircd --ports=6668`

Then, run aluigi's [peerchat server emulator](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm#peerchat) on port 6667.
